The React front end portion of the application is deployed [here] (https://hearthandsteel.netlify.com/)

# Motivation

As a food blogger, I want to be able to show off my work and recipes. I have a lot of amazing pics from the recipes i've created I'd like to share with potential clients, but I need a site that is more professional than Instagram in order to do so. I don't have time or skills to build my own unique website, I need a site that provides templates so I can just input some information and be done.

## Implemented Features

- Chef's can sign up + login and create a post for their food blog that is attached to their page. (I think for now we should only have a log in, as there will be 3 chefs that we want to log in as to show off functionality of a chef)
- A user can enter the site without authentication in order to view the chef's webpage and visit blog posts.
- User's can search through recipe title, meal type, chef, and ingredients.
